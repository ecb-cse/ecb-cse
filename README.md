Thanks RRSC-W to give an opportunity as Trainee.

Our Group Number is <b>C08</b> and We work under guidance of Gaurav Sir.
He is working as <b>Scientist/Engineer 'SE'</b> at RRSC-W, Jodhpur.

Our Project is <b>Cearting Web Application Using HTML5.</b></br>
Firstly We cover 6 steps:</br>
1: Show map layers</br>
2: Show manual pointed points on map</br>
3: Find user's location</br>
4: Generate pop-up to click on particular points</br>
5: Search places </br>
6: Show the Temperature on particular points</br>

We cover all the steps using <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayer map API</a>.</br>
<img src="img/openlayer.png" >
<b>OpenLayers</b> is an open source (provided under the 2-clause BSD License) JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers. It provides an API for building rich web-based geographic applications similar to Google Maps and Bing Maps. The library was originally based on the Prototype JavaScript Framework.</br>
OpenLayers was created by MetaCarta after the O'Reilly Where 2.0 conference of June 29–30, 2005, and released as open source software before the Where 2.0 conference of June 13–14, 2006, by MetaCarta Labs. Two other open-source mapping tools released by MetaCarta are FeatureServer and TileCache. Since November 2007, OpenLayers has been an Open Source Geospatial Foundation project.

Sir this is our web application. We try to show pop-up in openlayer3 but we can't do this. But we understand the openlayer2 and generate some <a href="https://ravirajpurohit.github.io/Error/map.html">pop-up on lo2 map.</a>
